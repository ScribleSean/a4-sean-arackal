## What do I have to do?

I chose to implement the web-application that I created for A3 to use React.js for the front-end. The front-end functionality is now specified. Overall, React made the development process much easier. There was a slight learning curve initially since I had to learn React's syntax and features. However, once I learned what I
could do with React, things got easier.

> HTML/CSS ID and Class selectors were used throughout the applicaion. 

> A Flexbox CSS Layout was used for this application.

> External stylesheet is present under `/css/main.css`

> HTML validates correctly.

> Client communicates with server via fetch

> Extra data can be created on the server based on data received from the client

> Results functionality to display entire dataset

> User has the ability to add entries


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page app. User can send data and the server sends back updated data which is then updated live on the display
- **Tech Achievement 2**: You can delete existing tasks

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement**: User Testing:

#### User Test 1
1. Last Name: Chang
2. Problems: allowing tasks to be added without specifying date, padding aound task name and due date look a little weird
3. Surprising Comments:  liking the color scheme
4. Changes I would make: more options to the app, better enforcing error alerts for invalid inputs and possibly even using something like sweetalert2
